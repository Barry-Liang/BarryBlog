Hello everyone, my name is Matthias. I'm a passionate C# developer and likes to talk about clean code, testing and tooling in general. Much of my spare time I devote to my very own open source projects. I am working at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) as developer advocate for the .NET department, but I'm also very interested in all things around [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) and a bit of [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
