Hello everyone, my name is Matthias. I'm a passionate C# developer and I like to talk about build automation, productivity, testing, and tooling in general. Much of my spare time I devote to my very own open source projects, including [NUKE](https://nuke.build). I am working at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) as developer advocate in the .NET department. That includes showing how awesome [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) and [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) are to work with. However, I'm also very interested in everything around [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
